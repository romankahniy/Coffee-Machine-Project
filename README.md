This is a console application for controlling a coffee machine that allows you to perform the following actions:
    buy coffee (espresso, latte, cappuccino)
    add ingredients (water, milk, coffee, glasses)
    take money
    check the balance of ingredients and money
    exit the program

How to use

Enter the appropriate command to perform the action. 

  If "buy" is selected, a sub-menu will appear to select the type of coffee. 
    If there are enough ingredients in the coffee machine, the console will display: "I have enough resources, making you a coffee!"
